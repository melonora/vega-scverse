        description: |-
          Opacity of axis tick labels.
        range: float
        minimum_value: 0
        maximum_value: 1
      labelFont:
        description: |-

        range: FontStyleEnum
      labelFontWeight:
        description: |-
          Font weight of axis tick labels.
        range: FontWeightEnum
      ticks:
        description: |-
          A boolean flag indicating if ticks should be included as part of the axis.
        range: boolean
        ifabsent: true
      tickOpacity:
        description: |-
          Opacity of axis ticks.

        minimum_value: 0
        maximum_value: 1
      tickColor:
        description: |-

        range: CapEnum
      tickWidth:
        description: |-
          Width in pixels of axis ticks.

        description: |-
          The length in pixels of axis ticks.
        range: float
        minimum_value: 0
      values:
        description: |-
          Explicitly set the visible axis tick and label values. The array entries should be legal values in the 
          backing scale domain.
        multivalued: true
        any_of:
          - range: float
          - range: integer
        required: true
      zindex:
        description: |-
          The integer z-index indicating the layering of the axis group relative to other axis, mark, and legend groups. 
          The default value is 0 and axes and grid lines are drawn behind any marks defined in the same specification 
          level. Higher values (1) will cause axes and grid lines to be drawn on top of marks.
        range: float
        required: true

enums:
  CapEnum:
    description: |-
      The style of the stroke end for axis tick marks.
    permissible_values:
      butt: |-
        The line ends exactly at its endpoint, producing a flat, squared-off edge perpendicular to the path. 
        There is no extension beyond the endpoint.
      round: |-
        The line ends with a semi-circular extension beyond its endpoint, creating a rounded cap with a radius equal to 
        half the line's thickness. This softens sharp edges and creates smooth joins.
      square: |-
        The line ends with a square extension beyond its endpoint. It is similar to butt but extends the line slightly 
        past the endpoint, by half the line's thickness, resulting in a squared-off cap that projects outward.
