  ViewConfiguration:
    attributes:
      height:
        description: |-
          The height of the plotting area. The plotting area is defined as the rectangular region within a visualization 
          where graphical marks (such as points, lines, or bars) are rendered, bounded by the axes and padding, 
          excluding titles, legends, and margins.
        range: integer
        required: true
      width:
        description: |-
          The width of the plotting area. The plotting area is defined as the rectangular region within a visualization 
          where graphical marks (such as points, lines, or bars) are rendered, bounded by the axes and padding, 
          excluding titles, legends, and margins.
        range: integer
        required: true
      padding:
        description: |-
          padding defines the amount of space (in pixels) to reserve between the edge of the chart container and the inner 
          view area where data marks are rendered. It acts as an internal margin that ensures visual elements like axes, 
          titles, and legends don’t touch or overflow the chart’s outer boundaries.
          When combined with "autosize": {"type": "fit", "contains": "padding"}, this padding is included within the chart's 
          specified width and height, and the inner view is resized accordingly to preserve layout integrity. If padding
          is defined with this class. This class should at least have one attribute defined.
        any_of:
          - range: float
          - range: Padding
      title:
        description: |-
          The title directive adds a descriptive title to a chart.
        range: Title
        required: false
      data:
        description: |-
          Scverse data set definitions and transforms define the data to load and how to process it.
        range: DataObject
        required: true
        multivalued: true
      scales:
        description: |-
          Scales map data values (numbers, dates, categories, etc.) to visual values (pixels, colors, sizes). 
          Scales are a fundamental building block of data visualization, as they determine the nature of visual 
          encodings.
        range: Scale
        multivalued: true
      axes:
        description: |-
          Axes visualize spatial scale mappings using ticks, grid lines and labels.
        range: Axis
        multivalued: true
      legends:
        description: |-
          Legends visualize scale mappings for visual values such as color, shape and size.
        range: Legend
        multivalued: true
      marks:
        description: |-
          Graphical marks visually encode data using geometric primitives such as rectangles, lines, and plotting 
          symbols. Marks are the basic visual building block of a visualization, providing basic shapes whose 
          properties can be set according to backing data. Mark property definitions may be simple constants or data 
          fields, or scales can be used to map data values to visual values.
        range: Mark
        multivalued: true
        required: true
