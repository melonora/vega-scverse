classes:
  Padding:
    description: |-
      padding defines the amount of space (in pixels) to reserve between the edge of the chart container and the inner 
      view area where data marks are rendered. It acts as an internal margin that ensures visual elements like axes, 
      titles, and legends don’t touch or overflow the chart’s outer boundaries.
      When combined with "autosize": {"type": "fit", "contains": "padding"}, this padding is included within the chart's 
      specified width and height, and the inner view is resized accordingly to preserve layout integrity. If padding
      is defined with this class. This class should at least have one attribute defined.
    # TODO linkml does not currently support json like minProperties to state that at least one attribute would be
    # required.
