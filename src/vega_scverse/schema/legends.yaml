    abstract: true
    attributes:
      type:
        description: |-
          The type of legend, either 'gradient' (continuous data) or 'discrete' (categorical data).
        range: LegendType
        required: true
      direction:
        description: |-
          The direction of the legend, one of 'vertical' or 'horizontal'.
        range: LegendDirections
        required: true
      orient:
        description: |-
          The orientation of the legend, determining where the legend is placed relative to a chart’s data rectangle. 
          Currently, only 'none' is allowed here as in Vega this allows to directly specify the positioning in 
          pixel coordinates. If there is demand, this can be changed.
        equals_string: none
        ifabsent: string(none)
      padding:
        description: |-
          The padding between the border and content of the legend group in pixels.

      fill:
        description: |-

          or continuous data in the legend.
        pattern: "^color_[0-9a-fA-F]{8}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{12}$"

      strokeWidth:
        description: |-
          The width of the legend border in pixels. This property deviates from its Vega equivalent, in that the
