  Scales:
    description: >
      Vega like definition for scales which specifies a collection of mappings from a data domain 
      (e.g., numbers, categories, dates) to a visual range (e.g., position on the screen, color spectrum, size).
    multivalued: true

      Base class for vega like scales which map from a data domain to a visual range, be it axis or color.
    attributes:
      name:
        description: >
          Name of the scale. Is used to refer to the scale in the rest of the view configuration. For scales used for
          axes typically `Y_scale` or `X_scale` optionally followed by `_n` where n stands for the index of the subplot.
          In case of a color mapping it is `color_` followed by a pseudo UUID.
        identifier: true
        required: true
        range: string
      type:
        description: >
          The type of scale which is a description of what kind of mapping is performed between data domain and 
          visual range, e.g. `linear`.
        required: true
        range: ScaleEnum

        description: `Y_scale` or `X_scale` optionally followed by `_n` where n stands for the index of the subplot
        pattern: ^[XY]_scale(_\d+)?$
      type:
        description: Only linear is supported for an `AxisScale` for now.

    attributes:
      domain:
        description: >
          The set of input data values that the scale maps from. In the case of a linear scale,
          this should be a two-element list representing the minimum and maximum numeric values
          to be transformed. For example, [512.0, 0.0] maps the data range from 512 (top) to 0 (bottom),
          which is typical for Y-axis scales in image coordinate systems where the origin is at the top-left.
        multivalued: true

    description: A vega like scale specifically for mapping from a data domain to an axis range.
    slot_usage:
      name:
        description: `Y_scale` or `X_scale` optionally followed by `_n` where n stands for the index of the subplot
        pattern: "^color_[0-9a-fA-F]{8}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{12}$"

enum:

    permissible_values:
      linear: Maps continuous numeric data to a continuous range.
      ordinal: Maps discrete values (categories) to distinct values in the output range.
